### Problem 1

This code below obtains a distribution for $\hat{r}^2$ by drawing
bootstrap samples; the a model to each andextracts the value I’m
concerned with and summarizes it summarize. Here, we’ll use
`modelr::bootstrap` to draw the samples and `broom::glance` to produce
`r.squared` values.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

``` r
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 5000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_density() +
   labs(
    x = "R Squared Values",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Distribution of R-Squared estimates for Central Park Weather"
  ) 
```

Based on the results, the $\hat{r}^2$ value is high. The upper bound at
1 may be a cause for the generally skewed shape of the distribution. If
we wanted to construct a confidence interval for $R^2$, we could take
the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the estimates across bootstrap samples.
However, since the shape of the curve generated isn’t symmetric, using
the mean +/- 1.96 times the standard error would probably not work well
in this case.

This code produces a distribution for $\log(\beta_0 * \beta1)$ using a
similar approach.

``` r
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(id = `.id`, term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = term, 
    values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(beta0 = `(Intercept)`, beta1 = tmin) %>% 
  mutate(log_b0b1 = log(beta0 * beta1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b0b1)) + geom_density() +
  labs(
    x = "Log(B0*B1)",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Distribution of Log(B0*B1) estimates for Central Park Weather"
  ) 
```

As with $r^2$, this distribution is approximately normally distributed
but also somewhat skewed and potentially has some outliers.
